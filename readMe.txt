Implementation:
1. EEG Data Acquisition: In this step we get raw EEG signal from the recording of EEG signal that has been done through Nervus EEG, USA with 64 channels at a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.05 Hz and 70 Hz. Totally, 62 active electrodes, one each for reference (AFz) and ground (Oz) are used in this work. All the electrodes are placed over the entire scalp using International standard 10-10 system. The impedance of the electrodes is kept below 5 k2.
2. Preprocessing: In this step, 4th order Butterworth filter is used with a cutoff frequency of 0.05 Hz - 60 Hz for removing the noises and artifacts and filtered signals are smoothened using Surface Laplacian (SL) filter.
3. Feature Extraction: In this step, the preprocessed EEG signals are framed into 5s frame duration with 50% overlap. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to extract the above said statistical features from four different frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma and alpha to gamma). Then characterize the EEG signals to easily discriminate the discrete emotions.
4. Emotion Classification: In this step, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are used for classifying the discrete emotions that "K" values ranging from 2 to 10 are tried for determining the emotion classification rate. In KNN classifier, the lower value of K, respectively gives the maximum mean emotion classification rate.
